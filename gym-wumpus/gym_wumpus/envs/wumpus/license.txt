The Hunt The Wumpus AI project was developed at University of Arizona
by Clay Morrison (clayton@sista.arizona.edu), spring 2013.
This project extends the python code provided by Peter Norvig as part of
the Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (AIMA) book example code;
see http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/code.html
In particular, the following files come directly from the AIMA python
code: ['agents.py', 'logic.py', 'search.py', 'utils.py']
('logic.py' has been modified by Clay Morrison in locations with the
comment 'CTM')
The file ['minisat.py'] implements a slim system call wrapper to the minisat
(see http://minisat.se) SAT solver, and is directly based on the satispy
python project, see https://github.com/netom/satispy .
