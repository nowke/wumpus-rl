<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>A total of 32 points can be earned over the course of this
project, but only 24 points are needed to get full credits; any points
over (8 more possible) will count as extra credit.  (There is no
specific part of the project that is extra credit; complete everything
you can!)</p>

<p>In this project, you will build a propositional logic (PL) agent
capable of solving a variant of the <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus">Hunt The
Wumpus</a> game.  This will include constructing the agent's knowledge
base and implementing simple search routines the agent uses for
planning.</p>

<p>The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of
which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the
assignment, and some of which you can mostly ignore.  You can download
all the code an supporting files (including this description) as a <a
 href="wumpus.zip">zip archive</a>.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The abreviation <b>AIMA</b> used below refers to the
Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig's book <a

Approach, 3rd Edition</a>, as well as the associated python code
available from their <a

instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing.  But, we don't know
when or how to help unless you ask.  One more piece of advice: if you
don't know what a variable does or what kind of values it takes, print
it out.</p>

<h3> Notes on terminology </h3>

<p>In the discussion and comments/docs in the code I freely switch
between referring to the agent <b>knowledge base</b>, <b>KB</b>,
<b>kb</b> and <b>agent.kb</b>.  These are all the same thing: the
collective facilities for storing propositional logic sentences.</p>

<p>I sometimes abbreviate <b>propositional logic</b> as <b>PL</b>.</p>

<p>PL sentences expressed in <em>full</em> propositional logic are
sentences that may include all of the standard PL connectives:
<em>And/Conjunction</em> ('<code>&amp;</code>'),
<em>Or/Disjunction</em> ('<code>|</code>'), <em>Not/Negation</em>
('<code>~</code>'), <em>Conditional</em> ('<code>&gt;&gt;</code>'),
and <em>Biconditional</em> ('<code><=></code>') (see <code><a
 href="docs/logic.html">logic.py</a></code> for full details about the
PL python implementation).  In the context of providing full PL
sentences to the KB as rules for updating the agent's knowledge state,
I will refer to these sentences as <b>axioms</b>.</p>

<p>When PL sentences are added to the KB, they are immediately
converted to conjunctive normal form, <b>CNF</b>.  This CNF
representation is stored in the KB as a <em>list</em> of the
individual disjunctive clauses (the list is treated as an implicit
conjunction of its member clauses), and I will refer to the clauses in
the list collectively as the KB <b>clauses</b>.  </p>

<h3> Setup: Install MiniSat, download project code, and run test </h3>

<p>This project relies on the light weight, open source, cross
platform SAT solver MiniSat (<a
 href="http://minisat.se">http://minisat.se</a>).  There are a variety
of ways to obtain MiniSat; here are methods for the popular three
platforms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Mac OS X</b>: 
  Several options:<br>
  (a) install using brew (recommended: <a
  href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>; may require first installing gcc<br>
      <code>$ brew install gcc</code><br>
      then<br>
      <code>$ brew install minisat</code><br>
  (b) install using port (<a
  href="http://macports.org">http://macports.org</a>); or<br> 
  (c) install from source following <a
  href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/minisat/9bahgMrbshQ/MAFeTUd0gmIJ">these
  instructions</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Linux</b>: <a
  href="http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/minisat2">Debian
  package</a>; or take a look at
  <a
  href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/minisat/bMyAAfrV4bg">this
  discussion</a></li>
  <li><b>Windows</b>: see <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~hook/logicw11/Assignments/MinisatOnWindows.html">these instructions</a></li>
</ul> 

<p>After installing MiniSat, download the Project 3 zip archive
  (<a href="wumpus.zip">wumpus.zip</a>) and unzip it (if you haven't
  already), and change to the <em>wumpus</em> directory.  You can then
  test the connection to MiniSat by executing the following from the
  command-line:</p>

<pre>python wumpus.py -t</pre>

<p>The three simple tests should pass.  If they do not, or you get
unexpected behavior, please contact me for help.</p>

<h3> Welcome to the Wumpus Caves! </h3>

<p>Having verified that the connection to MiniSat works, the next step
is to familiarize yourself with the Hunt The Wumpus game.  Execute the
following at the command-line to to play the game:</p>

<pre>python wumpus.py</pre>

<p>This launches the interactive command-line interface to the game,
running in "Manual" mode: you control the wumpus hunting agent.
Entering '<code>env</code>' at any point will display an ascii-art
representation of the current Wumpus enviroment state.  For example, when
executed in the first time tick, you will see:</p>

<pre>
     Scores: &lt;Explorer&gt;=0
       0   1   2   3   4   5    time_step=0
     |---|---|---|---|---|---|
     | # | # | # | # | # | # | 5
     |---|---|---|---|---|---|
     | # |   |   |   |   | # | 4
     |---|---|---|---|---|---|
     | # | W | G | P |   | # | 3
     |---|---|---|---|---|---|
     | # |   |   |   |   | # | 2
     |---|---|---|---|---|---|
     | # | ^ |   | P |   | # | 1
     |---|---|---|---|---|---|
     | # | # | # | # | # | # | 0
     |---|---|---|---|---|---|
</pre>

<p>At the top, the current score of the Wumpus hunting agent (in the
default manual mode, represented as an &lt;Explorer&gt;) is displayed.
The x coordinates of the Wumpus environment are displayed across the
row above the grid, and the y coordinates are displayed down the
right-side of the grid.  Each grid cell represents a wumpus cave room.
'#' represents a wall, and 'W', 'P', and 'G' represent the Wumpus, a
Pit, and the Gold, respectively.  The position of the wumpus hunter
agent are represented by '^', '<code>&gt;</code>', 'v', and
'<code>&lt;</code>', each of which show the direction (heading) the
hunter agent is currently facing.  At the start, the agent is in
location (1,1).</p>

<p>Enter
'<code>?</code>' at any time to see a complete list of commands.</p>

<p>The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score.  Each move
costs one point, shooting the arrow (irrespective of whether it kills
the Wumpus) costs 10 points, and leaving the caves (accomplished by
executing '<code>Climb</code>' in the same location that the hunter
agent started in (the cave 'entrance') <em>with</em> the Gold (i.e.,
having previously successfuly '<code>Grab</code>'bed the Gold), earns
1000 points.  Dying, by entering a square with the Wumpus or a Pit,
costs 1000 points.</p>

<p>At each time step, the current percepts are represented by a list
of the percept propositions ('~' represents that the proposition is
currently False).  For example, at time 0 (indicated in the brackets
on the left) the percepts for the environment depicted above are:</p>

<pre>
[0] You perceive: ['~Stench', '~Breeze', '~Glitter', '~Bump','~Scream']
</pre>

<p>Play several games and see how the Wumpus environment state
determines the percepts.  Try dying by moving into the Wumpus square
or a Pit.  Shoot the Wumpus: you must execute '<code>Shoot</code>'
while facing the Wumpus; when successful, the Wumpus will die and the
following time step you will perceive the '<code>Scream</code>'; also
note that the Wumpus is no longr represented by 'W', instead replaced
by an 'X'.  It is now safe to move into the Wumpus square.  Also solve
the game by moving to the Gold, executing '<code>Grab</code>', and
move back to the exit/entrance and execute '<code>Climb</code>'.</p>

<p>You can load different Wumpus environment layouts by specifying
either the name of an existing layout in the <a
 href="layouts/">wumpus/layouts/</a> directory (currently there are
only two provided), or by specifying the path to a layout, using this
command-line option:</p>

<pre>python wumpus.py -l 'wumpus_4x4_book'</pre>

<p>(You can optionally specify the layout extension '.lay'.)  The
format of a layout specification file is very simple; here's an
example:</p>

<pre>
.,.,.,.
W,G,P,.
.,.,.,.
A,.,P,.
</pre>

<p>The file format specifies the Wumpus environment grid as a series
of comma-separated wumpus-room specifications, with each row
representing a row of rooms in the Wumpus environment.  '.' represents
an empty wumpus room, 'W' places a Wumpus (the knowledge base you will
create below can only accommodate presence of exactly 1 Wumpus, no
more or less, but in the manual game you can have multiple Wumpi), 'P'
places a Pit, 'G' places the Gold (again, the KB will only support
Grabbing 1 Gold), and 'A' is the location of the Wumpus hunting Agent
(The Agent's heading is specified separately in code; North, or '^',
is the default).  You can also add Walls, represented by '#'.  By
default, the specified layout will be automatically surrounded by
Walls when the Wumpus environment is constructed.</p>

<p>Take a look at the code comments and examples in <code><a
 href="docs/wumpus.html">wumpus.py</a></code> to see how to construct
a WumpusWorldScenario from a layout file or by specifying directly in
code by constructing objects and assigning them to Wumpus environment
locations.</p>

<h4>General comments about the code structure and command-line options</h4>

<p>There are two main classes that together make a working version of
the Hunt the Wumpus game: the <code>WumpusEnvironment</code> and an
instance of an agent are combined in a
<code>WumpusWorldScenario</code>, defined in <code><a
 href="docs/wumpus.html">wumpus.py</a></code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>WumpusEnvironment</code>, defined in <code><a
 href="docs/wumpus_environment.html">wumpus_environment.py</a></code>,
represents the Wumpus cave environment, the position and state of all
objects, and enforces the rules of the game (the game 'physics'), such
as the effects of agent actions.  The <code>step()</code> method
advances the game one time step and includes calling the Wumpus hunter
agent's <code>agent_program</code>.</li>

<li>There are two classes that define Wumpus hunter agents.  The
<code>Explorer</code>, also defined in <code><a
href="docs/wumpus_environment.html">wumpus_environment.py</a></code>,
provides a minimal hunter agent skeleton, while the
<code>HybridWumpusAgent</code>, defined in <code><a
href="docs/wumpus_agent.html">wumpus_agent.py</a></code>,
is a full agent implementation and includes a knowledge base and set
of reflexes sufficient to solve any Hunt the Wumpus game (once you
provide some code).</li>
</ul>

<p>The main action of a wumpus hunter agent happens in its
<code>agent_program</code>.  There are three different
<code>agent_program</code>s provided:</p>

<ol type="1">
  
  <li>The function <code>with_manual_program</code> (in <code><a
href="docs/wumpus.html">wumpus.py</a></code>) takes an agent as input
  and replaces its <code>agent_program</code> with a "manual"
  <code>agent_program</code> in which the agent waits for commands
  from the command-line at each step.  This is the agent that is run
  when launching the game from the command-line with (with or without
  the '<code>-l</code>' layout file option):
  <pre>python wumpus.py</pre>
  This version is most useful for playing the game and verifying you
  understand the "physics" of the Wumpus environment (i.e., the
  effects ofa ctions of states of the world and subsequent
  percepts).</li>

  <li>The function <code>with_manual_kb_program</code> (also in <code><a
href="docs/wumpus.html">wumpus.py</a></code>) works similar to
  <code>with_manual_program</code> except the agent also creates a
  knowledge base and the <code>agent_program</code> updates a
  knowledge base with new percepts and the action selected (by the
  human user) at each step.  The user can also issue any relevant
  query about propositions in the knowledge base.  This option is most
  useful for developing and debugging the axioms you provide for
  initializing and updating the knowledge-based.  This version of the
  agent program can be run by executing the following from the
  command-line (inside the wumpus/ directory):
  <pre>python wumpus.py -k</pre>
  (You can also combine this with the '<code>-l</code>' option to load
  a specific layout.) Once launched, enter '<code>?</code>' to get the
list of commands and complete list of available query types.</li>

<li>The <code>HybridWumpusAgent</code> (HWA) class is defined in <code><a
href="docs/wumpus_agent.html">wumpus_agent.py</a></code> (it is a
subclass of the <code>Explorer</code>).  The HWA defines an
<code>agent_program</code> that implements the Wumpus agent as
specified in Figure 7.20, page 270 of AIMA.  Once you have correctly implemented the knowledge base
axiom generators (in <code><a
href="docs/wumpus_kb.html">wumpus_kb.py</a></code>), and the
<code>PlanRouteProblem</code> and <code>PlanShotProblem</code> methods (all
in <code><a
href="docs/wumpus_planners.html">wumpus_planners.py</a></code>), the
HWA <code>agent_program</code> will be able to solve any (solvable)
instance of the Hunt The Wumpus game.  The HWA and its
<code>agent_program</code> can be run from the command-line (inside
the wumpus/ directory) with:
<pre>python wumpus.py -y</pre>
(Again, you can also combine this with the '<code>-l</code>' option;
however, '<code>-y</code>' option will override the '<code>-k</code>'
option, if included).  When run, the HWA <code>agent_program</code>
will select all actions, so there is nothing for the human user to do
but watch.  As with the above options, the output to screen is
intentionally very verbose so that you can follow along with each step
in the execution.
<br><br>
To see what "correct" behavior should look like, I have provided the
output of two runs of the fully-implemented HWA, running on the <a href="layouts/">two
provided layouts</a>: <a
href="examples/HWA_lay_book_run.txt">HWA_lay_book_run.txt</a> and <a
href="examples/HWA_lay_2_run.txt">HWA_lay_2_run.txt</a>.
<br><br>
Also note that the number of clauses in the KB grows as the agent
takes actions in the environment. This is expected: at each time step,
new axioms are added to the knowledge base in order to represent
change (based on percepts and actions).  You will be implementing
these axiom generators.  The following two figures graphically show
the growth in the number of clauses and the time it takes to make one
kind of query (current location) over the 30 steps of the <a
href="examples/HWA_lay_2_run.txt">HWA_lay_2_run.txt</a> run.
</li>

</ol>

<center>
<img src="figs/clauses-over-epochs-2.png" height="260px" />
<img src="figs/query-time-over-epochs-2.png" height="260px" />
</center>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> While you can construct layout sepcifications (either
in layout files or in code) in any dimensions, it is recommend that
you follow these general constraints (mainly due to working with the
knowledge base; for general manual play without a KB, any size is fine):

<ul>
  <li>Do not create environments smaller than two rooms, as the knowledge
base assumes there is 1 and only 1 Wumpus, so a 1-room cave would
necessarily put the Wumpus in the same location as the entrance,
leading to a contradiction!</li>
  <li>Do not create environments greater than 16 rooms, as the KB will
grow in size too quickly and inference will bog down.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Development</h4>

<p>As the knowledge base and agent planner(s) developer, you have
several choices as to how to proceed with development.  The manual
command-line interfaces to the wumpus game, defined above and
implemented in <code><a href="docs/wumpus.html">wumpus.py</a></code>,
were designed to be a way by which you can directly observe the impact
of code changes on knowledge base inference and agent behavior.
However, you may find some or all development easier by incrementally
instantiating and testing parts of the code; in this case, start with
the <code>WumpusWorldScenario</code> to see how the main pieces are
put together.</p>


<h3>Propositional logic in python</h3>

<p>The two agent programs you will be working with (found either in
 <code>with_manual_kb_program</code> in <code><a
  href="docs/wumpus.html">wumpus.py</a></code> or the
 <code>HybridWumpusAgent</code> (HWA) class defined in <code><a
  href="docs/wumpus_agent.html">wumpus_agent.py</a></code>) make use
 of the <code>PropKB_SAT</code> knowledge base.  This is defined in
 <code><a href="docs/wumpus_agent.html">wumpus_agent.py</a></code> and
 is a subclass the <code>PropKB</code> class defined in <code><a
  href="docs/logic.html">logic.py</a></code>.  As you'll see, these
 are actually quite simple, implementing the <code>tell()</code>
 method to add new sentences to the knowledge base, and the
 <code>ask()</code> method to query the knowledge base
 (<code>ask()</code> is an interface MiniSat).  Assertions made to the
 knowledge base (often starting as PL syntax expressed in a string)
 are stored in the <code>clauses</code> field of the KB, and that is
 just a python list!  (Robust implementations of propositional KBs
 have much more sophisticated storage).  Representation of the
 assertions (sentences) themselves are built on top of the AIMA
 implementation of propositional logic.  As you will be implementing
 axiom generators, it is important you understand how propositional
 sentences, initially expressed in strings, are turned into the
 underlying propositional logic representations.  Take a look in
 <code><a href="docs/logic.html">logic.py</a></code>.  In particular,
 the following excerpt from the python prompt demonstrates some of the
 basic functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
In [1]: import logic

In [2]: a = '(A & B) >> ( ~(C | D) <=> E )'

In [3]: e = logic.expr(a)

In [4]: e
Out[4]: ((A & B) >> (~(C | D) <=> E))

In [5]: c = logic.to_cnf(e)

In [6]: c
Out[6]: ((~C | ~E | ~A | ~B) & (~D | ~E | ~A | ~B) & (E | C | D | ~A | ~B))

In [7]: logic.conjuncts(c)
Out[7]: [(~C | ~E | ~A | ~B), (~D | ~E | ~A | ~B), (E | C | D | ~A | ~B)]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>On line 2, I express a propositional sentence in a string, in the
syntax of the AIMA propositional language.  See the <code>Expr</code>
class in <code><a href="docs/logic.html">logic.py</a></code>.  The
function <code>expr()</code> parses that string and builds an
<code>Expr</code>.  The <code>Expr</code> object is designed to have a
"pretty" python representation, an example of which is on line 4 above
(this is accomplished by the definition of the <code>__repr__()</code>
method in Expr; see <a
 href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1984162/purpose-of-pythons-repr">this
explanation</a>).  But keep in mind that this is an object!  It has
two main fields: the operator, <code>op</code>, and a list of
arguments to the operator, <code>args</code>.  Since the variable
<code>e</code> currently references the Expr, we can inspect the
<code>op</code> and <code>args</code> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
In [10]: e.op
Out[10]: '>>'

In [11]: e.args
Out[11]: [(A & B), (~(C | D) <=> E)]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This shows that the Expr <code>e</code> refers to has as its
operator the conditional symbol, and its args have two entries, the
first being the antecedent to the conditional, in this case <code>A
&amp; B</code>, and the second is is the consequent, <code>~(C | D)
<=> E</code>.  Each of these are also Exprs, with the first having the
conjunction operator, <code>'&amp;'</code>, with two args
<code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.  In this way, our original Expr
referred to by <code>e</code> is actually the root of an Expr tree,
allowing for representation of arbitrarily complex sentences.</p>

<p>Be sure to look at the docs for <code>Expr</code> and
<code>expr()</code> in <code><a
 href="docs/logic.html">logic.py</a></code> to understand how the PL
syntax will be parsed from a string, in particular the note in the
docs of <code>expr()</code> about operator precedence: <code>expr('P &
Q ==> R & S')</code> will be parsed as <code>((P & (Q >> R)) &
S)</code>, which may not be what you intended!  To get the expected
operator precedence enforced (i.e., <code>&</code> with higher
precedence than <code>==></code>), you must use <code>expr('(P & Q)
==> (R & S)')</code>.  In general, it is best to use parentheses to
enforce the precedence you intend!</p>

<p>Moving on with the original example, on line 5 I convert the full
PL sentence into conjunctive normal form using the
<code>to_cnf()</code> function; line 6 shows the result.  This is still
an <code>Expr</code> object; also it is completely logically
equivalent to the previous form expressed on lines 2 and 4.  Whenever
an Expr is <code>tell()</code>ed to the KB, the Expr will be converted
to CNF.  Then the conjuncts of the CNF will be extracted so that what
is stored in the <code>clauses</code> store of the KB is a list of the
individual clauses of the CNF.  This is demonstrated on line 7.</p>

<p>Finally, a note about the use of MiniSat.  MiniSat is a SAT solver,
meaning that it searches for the a satisfying assignment to a set of
CNF clauses, return True if such an assignment is found (and in
MiniSat's case, it also returns the satisfying assignment), or False
if no assignment is found.  This is a good building block but not by
itself sufficient for propositional inference.  In our case, we will
not be doing full proposition inference, but instead asking whether
individual propositions are entailed (True) or not (False) by the KB,
or whether their truth cannot be determined.  In order to determine
which of these three possible outcomes is the case, the
<code>ask()</code> method of <code>PropKB_SAT</code> make <em>two</em>
calls to minisat, one which which the query variable (the proposition
who's truth we're trying to determine) is assumed to be True, and one
where it is assume to be False, and in both cases minisat determines
whether that assertion conjuncted with all of the clauses in the KB is
satisfiable.  If the clauses + query are satisfiable in <em>both</em>
cases, then that means the KB cannot determine whether the proposition
is True or False.  On the other hand, if one call to minisat is
satisfiable, but the other not, then the proposition's truth is which
of the calls was satisfiable.  In general you won't have to worry
about these details, but it is important to understand how this is
working!</p>

<h3>Construct the knowledge base</h3>

<p>OK, time to get to work!  The first set of tasks is to fill in the
axiom generators for the knowledge base.  For this part of the project
you will work in <code><a
 href="docs/wumpus_kb.html">wumpus_kb.py</a></code>, adding your code
to all locations indicated by <code>"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"</code>.
You will notice a pattern here, all of the methods you are
implementing start with "axiom_generator_..." in their name.  The doc
strings to these functions describe the knowledge that you need to
assert in propositional logic, with explanations of what the function
arguments represent.  The return values are assumed to be strings
representing the PL assertions.</p>

<p>Section 7.7 of AIMA, starting on page 265, is a good guide for a
number of the axioms you are required to implement.  But beware, it is
incomplete!</p>

<p>After the current percept sentence generator (which converts percept
vectors into a sentence asserting percept propositions), there are two
general classes of axiom generators you will construct: a set that
generate axioms describing the initial state of knowledge, and axioms
that represent changes over time (in particular, the successor-state
axioms).</p>

<p>The assertions your generators will make will be built out of
propositions.  The first section of <code><a
 href="docs/wumpus_kb.html">wumpus_kb.py</a></code> defines every
proposition that will appear in the KB.  Because it would be very easy
to add a malformed proposition symbol to the KB without knowing it, I
have provided a set of proposition string builder functions, one for
each type of proposition.  Even though it is more verbose to use
function calls like <code>percept_breeze_str(3)</code> rather than
just '<code>Breeze3</code>', you'll be better off, as the KB itself
won't tell you if you happened to have mistakenly asserted
'<code>Breez3</code>' (that's a misspelling!) -- the KB will happily
accept it and you'll be left to find your mistake through painful
debugging!  However, the choice is entirely up to you -- nothing about
the grading will check whether you use these string-builders</p>

<p>You will be working a lot with strings in this part of the
project.  Here are general python string functions that I found useful
while building my solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The  plus sign is overloaded: <code>'a' + 'b'</code> results
  in <code>'ab'</code></li>
  
  <li>The <code>join</code> method is very handy; the first string the
  join being called on will be inserted between the listed strings
  being joined (use an empty string to just concatenate the list of
  strings):

  <ul>
    <li><code>''.join(['a','b','c'])</code> results in
    <code>'abc'</code></li>
    <li><code>'-'.join(['a','b','c'])</code> results in 'a-b-c'</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>The <code>format</code> method is your friend: <code>'string
  with {0}{1}'.format('stu', 'ff')</code><br>results in <code>'string
  with stuff'</code></li> </ul>

<p>Points will be awarded, pending correct implementation, as follows
  (for a total of 24 points):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_percept_sentence</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_initial_location_assertions</code> = 0.5 pt</li>
  <!-- The following two are a little more involved, but once you
       have one, the other is very similar, so
       I'm distributing two points across them. -->
  <li><code>axiom_generator_pits_and_breezes</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_wumpus_and_stench</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_at_least_one_wumpus</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_at_most_one_wumpus</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_only_in_one_location</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_only_one_heading</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_have_arrow_and_wumpus_alive</code> = 0.5 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_location_OK</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_breeze_percept_and_location_property</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_stench_percept_and_location_property</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_at_location_ssa</code> = 4 pts</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_have_arrow_ssa</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_wumpus_alive_ssa</code> = 1 pt</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_heading_{north,east,south,west}_ssa</code> = 3 pts
  (for the set)</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_heading_only_{north,east,south,west}</code> = 2 pts
  (for the set)</li>
  <li><code>axiom_generator_only_one_action_axioms</code> = 2 pts</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> While you are constructing the knowledge base
generators, the KB should always be satisfiable.  If it ever becomes
unsat, then something you have added is leading to a contradiction!
That is always a problem.  To check for satisfiability of the KB, call
the <code>minisat()</code> function in <code><a
 href="docs/wumpus_agent.html">wumpus_agent.py</a></code> with just
the KB clauses, e.g., <code>minisat(kb.clauses)</code>; when running
the wumpus.py with a KB (option <code>-k</code>) from the
command-line, you can enter the '<code>kbsat</code>' command to do the
same thing.  Note, however, that just because the KB is satsifiable
does not mean there are not other problems.</p>

<h3>Implement route and shot planning</h3>

<p>The second major task of Project 3 is to complete the
  implementation of the route and shot planning for the Hybrid Wumpus
  Agent.  Your coding will take place in <code><a
   href="docs/wumpus_planners.html">wumpus_planners.py</a></code>.
  The docs for <code>plan_route</code> and <code>plan_shot</code>
  outline the problem, but the code to be added will be in the
  <code>PlanRouteProblem</code> and <code>PlanShotProblem</code>
  classes, both of which extend the search <code>Problem</code> class
  (defined in <code><a href="docs/search.html">search.py</a></code>)
  that serves as the interface to the AIMA search code.

<p>The <code>goal_test</code> in both problems is initially set to
  always return True, and both <code>plan_route</code> and
  <code>plan_shot</code> will return empty action lists if finding a
  solution fails.  This allows you to run the full Hybrid Wumpus Agent
  even before these planning facilities are implemented, but obviously
  you'll be changing things.</p>

<p>Once implemented, both <code>plan_route</code> and
  <code>plan_shot</code> will use the AIMA implementation of A*, which
  is also defined in <code><a
   href="docs/search.html">search.py</a></code> (as
  <code>astar_search()</code>).</p>

<p>It is recommended that you implement <code>PlanRouteProblem</code>
  first, as much of the solution there can be used in
  <code>PlanShotProblem</code>.  Remember, for the
  <code>PlanShotProblem</code>, you only need to plan a path to the
  closest location in which you will be facing the Wumpus.</p>

<p>As noted in <code>plan_route</code> and <code>plan_shot</code>, the
representation of a state is a triple representing the x, y
location and heading, of the agent.  The heading is an integer of 0,
1, 2, or 3, representing North, West, South, and East, respectively.
Goals and allowed states, however, ignore heading, and thus are just
lists of x,y tuples.  <code>manhattan_distance_with_heading()</code>
has been provided; as the name suggests, it computes the Manhattan
distance, but also adds in the cost of having to change the heading
(i.e., turn to the correct orientation) before following the Manhattan
path.</p>

<p>Correct implementation of each search problems is worth 4 points each,
for a total of 8 points.</p>
